# MULTI: Multi-Objective Effort-Aware Just-in-Time Software Defect Prediction

Datasets, scripts, and results for our paper:  MULTI: Multi-Objective Effort-Aware Just-in-Time Software Defect Prediction, which has been submitted to information science and technology

Directories dataset and dataset_tw store all the datasets we used in our experiments; In particular, dataset directory store the datasets used in cross-validation and cross-project validation scenarioes. dataset_tw store the datasets used in timewise-cross-validation scenario.

Directories dataoupt_cp, dataoupt_cv, and dataoupt_tw, respectively save the results obtained by our proposed MOFES in  cross-validation, cross-project-validation, and timewise-cross-validation scenarioes;

Script directory contains all the code script for MOFES used to repeat our empirical studies.

The usages of scripts:
Use Matlab to open TimeWise.m, WithinProject.m, or CrossProject.m, respectively, corresponding to timewise-cross-validation, cross-validation and cross-project-validation.

Press Ctrl plus A selected all , press F9 to execute, all the results are automatically saved in the corresponding directory.
